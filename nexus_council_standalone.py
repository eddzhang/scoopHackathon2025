📋 **NEXUS COUNCIL DECISION**

After extensive deliberation, the Council recommends:

**Decision: PROCEED WITH CAUTION** ⚠️

**Key Findings:**
1. Legal: Critical compliance issues identified that require immediate attention
2. Tax: Significant financial exposure that needs restructuring
3. Growth: Strong market opportunity but must be balanced with compliance

**Required Actions Before Proceeding:**
1. Complete comprehensive legal review and implement safeguards
2. Restructure operations to minimize tax nexus exposure
3. Phase rollout to balance growth with compliance milestones

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Compliance Priority:** CRITICAL
**Implementation:** Phased approach with legal checkpoints

The Council emphasizes that while the growth opportunity is compelling, 
regulatory compliance and tax optimization must be addressed to ensure 
long-term sustainability and avoid potentially catastrophic penalties.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Implement basic compliance documentation
2. Set up tax-efficient structure as outlined
3. Launch quickly while maintaining audit trail

**Risk Assessment:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Growth Priority:** HIGH
**Implementation:** Immediate with compliance monitoring

The Council finds this opportunity favorable with manageable risks.
Proceed with implementation while maintaining compliance documentation.
